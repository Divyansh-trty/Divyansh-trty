ðŸ‘¾ Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Breaking Stuff to Learn | ðŸ’» Scripting My Way Through the Matrix
Hey there! I'm diving deep into the world of cybersecurityâ€”one script, exploit, and write-up at a time. This repo is my digital playground where I experiment with real-world vulnerabilities, build security tools, and automate the boring stuff. Whether it's recon, reverse engineering, or red teaming, you'll find bits of everything here.

Always learning. Always hacking (legally). Always caffeinated. â˜•ðŸ’¥
